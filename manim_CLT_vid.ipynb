    "Imagine rolling an ordinary 6 sided dice. Everyone knows that for a single dice, all 6 outcomes are equally likely. The distribution is completely flat across all outcomes. However, if add up two dice rolls, the distribution is not flat, but peaked like a triangle at the most common outcome 7. For a sum of 3 dice, 10 and 11 are the most likely outcomes, and the distribution is now more rounded at the peak. As you add more and more dice, the distribution gets smoother and smoother. After summing just 5 dice, we can start to see that the distribution looks like the infamous bell curve shaped Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that this distribution looks like a bell curve when you roll many dice is exactly the idea of the central limit theorem. This states that any sum of n random numbers gets closer and closer to a Gaussian distribution in the limit n goes to infinity. In other words, the distribution at the top of the screen from dice gets closer and closer to the distribution at the bottom of the screen for Gaussians. Of course, as with every theorem in math, there are terms and conditions that apply, but nevertheless this approximation can be incredibly useful. Since there is a nice exact formula for the standard Gaussian distribution in terms of the function e to the minus x^2 we can use the central limit theorem to closely approximate probabilities for dice rolls without having to worry about the details of 6 sided dice at all! For example, you can immeddiatly calculate that there is approximately a 68% chance that the sum of 5 dice will be in the range 14 to 21, because this range represents one standard deviation around the average of 17.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the really amazing thing about the central limit theorem is that it works for ANY random variables, not just dice rolls! For some reason, no matter what distributon X you start with, when you add up independent copies of X together, the same Gaussian shape always appears in the end. This is truly surprising to me. Why should all sums of random variables converge to one special final distribution when you add them up? What is so special about the Gaussian distribution? What is the \"force\" so to speak that pushes sums of random variables into the Gaussian distribution as you add more and more copies toghether? \n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This curve is an incredible good continuous approximation for the discrete sum of dice rolls. Mathematically, the bell curve is known as the Gaussian distribution and has a nice exact formula involving to the minus z squared. It is traditional to use the letter Z for Gaussian's, and what we are saying is that, as random variables, the sum of 5 dice is well approximated by the random variable Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem is the statement this approximation holds not just for dice rolls, but for almost ANY sum of random variables. Mathematically, we can write that the sum X_1 plus X_2 plus dot dot dot all the way to X_n is well aprrimated by Z when n grows large where now the Xs are independet copies from an aribitary distribution. The really amazing thing about this theorem, is that the same Gaussian distribution is the inevitable final result no matter what X is. No matter what you start with, you always end up with a bell curve in the end!\n",

    "One way to answer the question of why sums become Gaussian is to look at the operation of convolution between two functions, written f star g. 3Blue1Brown has a wonderful series of videos explaining how exactly the central limit theorem works in terms of convolutions. On one side, summing random variables exactly corresponds to the convolution of their distributions. This means our sum of Xs at the top of the screen corresponds to doing n many convolutions. On the other side, 3Blue1Brown shows a truly beautiful visualization using the symmetry of Gaussians to show that Gaussians are closed under convoluions, and this can be used to prove the central limit theorem. The link to the whole series is in the description if you haven't seen these videos yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In THIS video, there are no convolutions. Instead, I am going to explain WHY the central limit theorem is true from a completly different point of view. This is one of my favourite things about math; you can see the same problem from multiple points of view and learn something new from each unique perspective. Instead of convolutions, I am going to look at a particular special sequence of numbers. *numbers slam in* \n",

    "This sequence is made of double factorials, which are written with not one, but two exclamation points! Instead of multiplying together all the numbers like an ordinary factorial, in double factorials we skip over every other number when multiplying. So for example, 3 double factorial on our list is 3 times 1. 5 double factorial on our list is 5 times 3 times 1 which gives the number 15 on our list. 105 is 7 times 5 times 3 times 1 is 7 double factorial. For reasons we'll soon see, our special sequence actually only has the odd double factorials in it, and has zeros in every other entry. In other words our sequence is a 50-50 mix of double factorials and zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this video, I will explain why this sequence connects to both Gaussians at the bottom of the screen and to sums of arbitary random variables at the top of the screen in a way that proves the central limit theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the Gaussian side, the connection is to look at the average of powers of the standard Gaussian random variable Z. That is the expected value of Z to the power k for integers k. These are called the moments of the Gaussian. It turns out that these moments are exactly our special sequene. When k=1, we have simply the mean of a standard Gaussian which is 0, the very first number on our list. When k=2, we have the expected value of Z squared, which is 1 for a standard Gaussian and is the second number on our list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like derivatives have names like postion, velocity and acceleration, moments have names too. The first and second moment are the mean and variance, which we've seen are 0 and 1. The third and fourth moment are sometimes called skewness and kurtosis. Reading from our list, we can see the skewness of the standard Gaussian is 0 and the Kurtosis of the Gaussian is 3. {cut this?}\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, all the even moments are the double factorials on our list, and the odd moments are all zero. Later in the video I will show how you can calculate this directly from the e to the minus x squared probability density formula for the Gaussian. This sequence of moments can be thought of as a kind of fingerprint for the distribution; if you know can measure all the moments, you can figure out what distribution it came from. So our special sequence here are the fingerprints of the Gaussian...wherever we find these fingerprints we can be sure a Gaussian is lurking around somewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is exactly how we will connect Gaussians to arbitarity sums of random variables. For sums of random variables, we will also compute the moments by taking the expected value of the sum to the power k. Unlike the Gaussian, we don't have a simple probability density function for the sum, so we will instead expand out this big sum to the power k as a sum of many many terms. As will be explained later in the video, a true combinatorial miracle happens here, and it turn out that this expected value can be written in a simple way: the expeded value will depend only on the number of ways to partition k items into pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when k equals 4, we are paritioning 4 items into pairs. If we label them as A,B,C,D we can start thinking of all the ways to do this. One example is to pair A with C and B with D. Another way would be to pair A with B and then C with D. Or yet another way is to pair A with D and B with C. These are the only ways to pair things up for 4 items, because there are 3 choices for whose A partner will be, and once A's partner is chosen, the remaining two items must autmatically be paired. The fact that there are 3 ways to do this exactly corresponds to the number 3 on our special double factorial sequence when k=4. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem kind of like magic: what do these weird pariing have to do with expected values of sums? We'll see when we do the details later on that the four \"items\" we are pairing are the four copies of the sum X_1 plus X_2 plus dot dot dot X_n, and the pairing really correspond in a very real way to selecting specific terms out of this big soup of algebra.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving the details on how this works for later, lets look at what happens when k equals 5. Now we have 5 items A,B,C,D and E which we want to group into pairs. There are actually 0 ways to do this at all, because 5 is odd! This exactly corresponds to the 5th number on our special sequence being 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "When k equals 6, we are paritioning 6 objects into pairs. For example, A could pair with B, C could pair with D, and E could pair with F. In fact, there are actually 3 total possible pairing where A is paired with B. This is because once A and B are paired together, there are 4 items remaining, and we saw already that there are 3 ways to pair up 4 items. But acutally there are 5 different choices for who A could could be paired with, which means we can organize all the possible pairings into a 3 by 5 grid as shown here. In each column, A is paired with someone different, A paired with B on the leftmost column, all the way up to A paired with F on the rightmost column. Once the partner for A is chosen from these 5 possibiliteis, there are 3 pairings possible in each row. You can think of this as choosing a one of the 3 remaining possible partners for the next item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that there are are 5 times 3 equals 15 total possible pairings of 6 objects, which exactly corresponds to the fact that the 6th number in our special double factorial sequence is 15. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the number of ways to create this kind of pair partition is exactly the number on our special double factorial list. When k is even, there are k-1 double factorial ways to create this pair partion by choosing one of the k-1 partners for A, then one of the k-3 partners for the next item and so on. When k is odd, there are simply no ways to make such a pairing. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two remarkable facts connecting the moments of arbitarty sums and the moments of the Gaussian to the double factorials will explain why the central limit theorem holds. The Gaussian distribution is special because the moments of the Gaussian are exactly counting these pair partitions which arise naturally whenever you do the sum of ANY random variables. The rest of the video will have two parts, first explaining the result for the moments of sums and pair partitions, and second using the formula for the Gaussian probabiolity density function to compute its moments. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher moments are all given by the numbers on our list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at higher powers, we will see that the expected value of these higher powers is exactly the rest of the numbers in the sequence. The odd powers like expected value of Z to the 3 or expected value of Z to the 5 are always 0, and the even powers are given by the double factorial numbers. For example the expected value of Z to the power 8 works out to 105. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence is called the moment sequence for the gaussian Z. \"Moment\" here just means the expected value of Z to some power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the way expanding out powers works, it is going to turn out that this expected value is going to \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "approximately the number of ways to divide k objects into pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers are intimately connected to Gaussians because they are the so-called moments of the standard Gaussian. We create a standard Gaussian by setting the mean to be 0 and the variance to be 1, and we get a nice simple formula for the probabilty density. If we then calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "and then this sequence perfectly tell us the expectation of POWERS of the standard gaussian. The first term is just the expected value of Z to to the one. This is zero since the mean of a standard Gaussian is zero. The second moment is the expected value of Z to the power 2. This is exactly 1 for a standard Gaussian. The rest of the sequence tells us the expectation of higher powers. We can see that the odd moments, like expectation of Z to the 3 are all zero. The even moments are the double factorials: the products of all the odd numbers below them.\n",
    "\n",
    "then this sequence tells us the average value of Z to any power. The first term is the mean of Z, and the second is the mean of Z squared."
